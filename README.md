# [Recommender Systems: an overview](https://bekyilma.github.io/RecSys/)



Recommender Systems (RecSys) are ubiquitous and have become inseparable parts of our everyday lives. They are central to our experience with the digital world in everything we do and every service we consume. They help us find our favourite items to purchase, our friends on social networks, our favourite movies to watch, music to listen to, and books to read. Nowadays, RecSys have numerous applications that transcend these classic taste-driven domains of social media and entertainment and are revolutionising several sectors. Education, industriy, healthcare, tourism, transport and logistics are among the areas where the applications of RecSys have gained momentum.



This course is designed to get you introduced to Recommender systems and provide you with the state-of-the-art tools and algorithms to design and build RecSys engines. By the end of this course you will be able to:


  - Develop foundational knowledge on Recommendation systems.
  - Understand a wide variety of Recommendation system algorithms.
  - Understand how to design and evaluate Recommendation systems in different application domains.
  - Apply the learned skills to design Recommendation engines using real datasets, evaluate the designed engines and report results.
